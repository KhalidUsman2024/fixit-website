                <p>At Saylani Welfare International Trust, we firmly believe that education is the cornerstone of
                    progress and development. The Saylani Mass IT Training Program (SMIT) was initiated with the vision
                    of empowering individuals through modern technology and equipping them with skills that can shape
                    their future. In today’s fast-paced digital era, it is essential to bridge the gap between talent
                    and opportunity. Through SMIT, we aim to provide free, high-quality training in the IT sector,
                    enabling students from all backgrounds to excel and contribute to society.</p>
